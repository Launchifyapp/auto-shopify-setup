# Compliance webhooks are mandatory for apps distributed through the Shopify App Store
# These webhooks handle GDPR/CCPA data requests and deletion requests
#
# For development: Use relative URIs (Shopify CLI handles the host automatically)
# For production: Replace with absolute HTTPS URLs before deployment
#
# The following topics MUST be handled:
# - customers/data_request: Customer requests their personal data (GDPR Article 15)
# - customers/redact: Customer requests deletion of their data (GDPR Article 17)
# - shop/redact: Shop data deletion after uninstall (48h grace period)
